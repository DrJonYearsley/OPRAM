# OPRAM

The primary goal of this project is to provide a practical visual tool that communicates scientific evidence to stakeholders involved in Ireland's plant biosecurity policy and pest/pathogen-risk management. This supports the objectives of Ireland's Plant Health and Biosecurity Strategy 2020-2025 (DAFM 2019): "To minimise the threat posed to plants by the potential introduction and establishment of plant pests and diseases".
